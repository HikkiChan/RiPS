In this tutorial, you will learn to use TFLearn and TensorFlow to estimate
Titanic passengers likelihood of survival based on their personal information. To
tackle this classic machine learning task, we are going to build a deep neural
network classifier. Make sure you have TensorFlow and TFLearn installed. If
you dont, please follow these instructions. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic
sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and
crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the
sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as
women, children, and the upper-class. In this tutorial, we carry out an analysis
to discover who these people are. Просто текст, написанный на русском языке. Code:<private static void main(String[] args) {System.out.println("Hello, World!")}>.
